# OpenScan Hardware

This document describes our approach to documenting microscopes built on
optical breadboards for the purpose of sharing as open hardware.

As a concrete example, a basic two-photon scanning microscope is (to be)
described using the approach. It is hoped that variations, extensions, and
other designs (confocal, ...) will be added by us and othersâ€”the intent is to
provide something where people can contribute and also reuse as a baseline for
documenting microscope builds they develop.

**Current Status:** It is very early days. Most sections are missing.
